Welcome to George's website, where you can learn all about his passion for statistics and data analytics. George is a driven individual who is dedicated to using data to solve real-world problems. Here's a bit more about him:

## About me:
Hi there! My name is George, and I am a passionate scholar of statistics and data analytics. I believe that data can be used to solve a wide range of problems, and I am dedicated to mastering the tools and techniques needed to do so.

## Education:
I have a Bachelor of Science degree in Economics and Statistics from Kenyatta University. During my undergraduate program, I gained valuable skills in statistical analysis and learned how to describe how people, businesses, and governments behave economically. I am now seeking further education in data science and analytics through the Coursera and DataCamp platforms.

## Skills:

I have a wide range of skills that are essential for any data professional. Some of my areas of expertise include:

* Data Cleaning and Manipulation: I use the Tidyverse Framework, Microsoft Power Query, and Pivot Tables to clean and manipulate data.

* Parametric Analysis and Hypothesis Testing with R: I use R to perform parametric analysis and hypothesis testing.

* Sampling Techniques: I use probability sampling in R to select samples for analysis.

* Data Visualization: I use Excel, Ggplot2, and Microsoft Power BI to create visualizations that help communicate complex data.

* Text Analysis with tidytext package in R: I use R's tidytext package to perform text analysis on large datasets.

* SQL: I use SQL's Data Manipulation Language to manipulate and analyze data.

* Collaborating: I use GitHub to collaborate with others on data projects.

* Reporting: I use R Markdown to create clear and concise reports that summarize my findings.

* Forecasting: I use time series analysis to make predictions about future trends and behavior.

* Supervised Machine Learning: I use algorithms such as linear regression, XGBOOST, decision trees, and random forests to build predictive models that can be used to make informed decisions.

With my expertise in forecasting and supervised machine learning, I can help you make sense of your data and make informed decisions based on your findings. Contact me today to learn more about how I can help you with your data-related needs.

## Projects:

#### [Analysing Sales Product and Sales Data](content/products_trends_report.html)

-   The aim of this project is to analyze the sales data of REC Corp LTD. and provide valuable insights into their business. Our analysis will help the company make informed decisions about their products and improve their overall performance.

#### [Naive Bayes Classification of Customer Purchasing Behavior](content/naive_bayes.html)

-   In this project, the aim is to predict whether a customer will purchase an iPhone or not using the customer's demographic information such as gender, age, and salary as input variables. The project was implemented using the Naive Bayes classifier in the R programming environment.

#### [K-Nearest Neighbor Classification of Iris Species](content/KNN_with_iris.html)

-   In this project, the aim was to implement the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier to classify iris species based on their sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The iris dataset was used as the source of the data for the project.

#### [Analyzing World Population Data](content/script.html)

-   This ongoing project looks at population increase in Kenya and other parts of the world between 1960 and 2020. The research also looks into how different income groups impact a country's population and regional trends in population increase.

#### [HR Employee Analytics and Behavior Prediction](content/Project_Report.html)

-   As part of this project, I performed exploratory data analysis on employee data and created a logistic regression model to forecast whether or not an employee would quit the organization using key variables derived from EDA. The model revealed that if the company increased employee satisfaction level by one unit, the probability of an employee leaving reduced by 58.56 percent.

#### [Analyzing the gapminder dataset with SQL](content/working-with-the-gapminder-dataset.html)

-   I used sequel to analyze the gapminder dataset from the `gapmider` library for this project. The SQL data manipulation language allowed me to practice data retrieval, aggregation, and analysis.
