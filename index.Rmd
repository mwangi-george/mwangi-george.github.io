### Profile

First off, I recently finished my undergraduate studies from Kenyatta University's where I took Economics and Statistics and attained First Class Honors. I learned essential skills in this course, like conducting statistical analysis, making the most optimal decisions, and creating practical economic models. In addition, I am now enrolled in Coursera's online data analyst certification program.

Second, I am proficient in the R programming language, which I use to cleanse, manipulate, and analyze various data sets. I'm able to produce reproducible HTML reports that may be published on a website by using Markdown tools in R programming. The ability to manipulate, access, and update data stored in a variety of relational database management systems, including Microsoft SQL Server and SQLite, is another skill I possess.  Kindly see out the code I've written in these potent programming languages on my GitHub page.

Moreover, I am proficient in using spreadsheets and other Microsoft office programs. With the use of these abilities, I can perform analysis that is timely, accurate, and dependable and use it to draw conclusions, make projections, and influence decisions. These abilities make me confident that I can contribute to a data analytics team.
