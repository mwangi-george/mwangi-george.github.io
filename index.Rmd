## Projects

#### [Analysing Sales Product and Sales Data](content/products_trends_report.html)
* The aim of this project is to analyze the sales data of REC Corp LTD. and provide valuable insights into their business. Our analysis will help the company make informed decisions about their products and improve their overall performance.

#### [Naive Bayes Classification of Customer Purchasing Behavior](content/naive_bayes.html)
* In this project, the aim is to predict whether a customer will purchase an iPhone or not using the customer's demographic information such as gender, age, and salary as input variables. The project was implemented using the Naive Bayes classifier in the R programming environment.

#### [K-Nearest Neighbor Classification of Iris Species](content/KNN_with_iris.html)
* In this project, the aim was to implement the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier to classify iris species based on their sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The iris dataset was used as the source of the data for the project.

#### [Analyzing World Population Data](content/script.html)
* This ongoing project looks at population increase in Kenya and other parts of the world between 1960 and 2020. The research also looks into how different income groups impact a country's population and regional trends in population increase.

#### [HR Employee Analytics and Behavior Prediction](content/Project_Report.html)
* As part of this project, I performed exploratory data analysis on employee data and created a logistic regression model to forecast whether or not an employee would quit the organization using key variables derived from EDA. The model revealed that if the company increased employee satisfaction level by one unit, the probability of an employee leaving reduced by 58.56 percent.

#### [Analyzing the gapminder dataset with SQL](content/working-with-the-gapminder-dataset.html)
* I used sequel to analyze the gapminder dataset from the `gapmider` library for this project. The SQL data manipulation language allowed me to practice data retrieval, aggregation, and analysis.


## Sample Data Analysis Reports

* **[Forecasting App](content/forecast_plots.html/index.html)**
* **[Time Series Plots](content/selected_10_ts.html/index.html)**
* **[Initial Visualization](content/initial_viz/index.html)**
